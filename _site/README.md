CRUK Communication preferences
==============================

Static HTML files can be found in the `_site` folder.

Notes from JGP:

Main page:

The design with images came out on top by a long way - we’re concerned that on mobile it’s too busy though - so can we remove the images on the mobile view? Can we change for Cancer -> beat cancer on the categories that mention that: - Campaigning for cancer -> Campaigning to beat cancer - Other Runs for Cancer -> Other Runs to beat cancer - Walk for Cancer -> Walk to beat cancer - Other sports for Cancer -> Other sports to beat cancer - Challenges for Cancer -> Challenges to beat cancer

Research, breakthroughs and news -> Breaking news ­ Science, Health & Progress

Donate: Fun ways to donate to beat cancer -> Donate: Whatever you can give makes a huge difference

Can we please add in an extra Stand up category Stand up to Cancer - Two months of epic fundraising up and down the country with Channel 4

We’re going to have everything ticked to begin with - do you guys need to change anything on the markup to make that happen or will Experian do it?

Can we change the title from Communication preferences -> Email preferences

Can we change the wording under questions and comments to: If you have problems with this form, or need to talk to us about anything else you can contact us in the following ways:

Confirmation Page:

Thanks for popping these in - think we totally forgot to mention them

We’ll just use the http://crukorg.github.io/mail-prefs/unsubscribe.html page - but we’ll have to remove the resubscribe button

Can the wording be: Thank you for updating your preferences. It should take no more than a few days to update your records.

These changes will not affect non marketing communications from us, for example confirmation of donations, registrations or order confirmations.

Can we please include the Questions or Comments box as on the page before
